## buyDeis Final Report - SWE Capstone Project

buyDeis is an application designed to provide the Brandeis student body with a space for trading/selling items that they are no longer in need of. It is also a platform where students can connect with each other through their presence of the creations/goods that they sell online. 

You can check out our application [here](https://buydeis.herokuapp.com/).
